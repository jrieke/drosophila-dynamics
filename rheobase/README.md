Simulated /NeuroML2/isopotential_NeuroML2/run.xml with varying values for Ipulse from 10 ms to 5000 ms (in some cases, an out of memory error showed up before the simulation was over).
.dat files contain raw data output, where filename is Ipulse. Columns in .dat files are: t / ms, V / mV, I / pA
Results were verified with isopotential.ode.
