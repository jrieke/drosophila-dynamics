Code and data for my bachelor thesis: **Characterizing the dynamics of a *Drosophila* motoneuron model via bifurcation analysis**

The text for the thesis is [here](https://github.com/jrieke/bachelor-thesis), the computational model that I use is [here](https://github.com/cengique/drosophila-aCC-L3-motoneuron-model). 

**Note**: The data files are hosted via Git Large File Storage. To get them, [download](https://git-lfs.github.com/) and install, then run ```git lfs pull``` on the command line.
